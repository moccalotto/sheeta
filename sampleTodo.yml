    rows:
      - - Feature
        - Add »squashable« feature for columns.
          Enable columns with extremely long text to have a small preview.
          The long text will be shown in a modal in its entirety.
      - - Feature
        - Add a "sortable" property to tables or columns.
          Possibly hint if we should sort by date, text or number.
      - - Feature
        - Eanble cell-level customization for advanced tables.
          In order to build the perfect character sheet, we
          need tables where each cell in a column has different
          properties; some may be editable, some may not.
          Cells should only be customizable if the column is marked
          as "customizable". For instance. it would be impossible to
          sort or filter a customizable column.
      - - Feature
        - Date and DateTime cell/column datatypes.
      - - Feature
        - Support for filtering/searching in columns.
          Of course this should be optional.
      - - UI
        - Support for advanced UI. Placing tables inside pre-defined areas.
          Maybe add an "areas" section to the Sheet. Each area has a name/id and
          a set of attributes. Each table then resides in the area - possibly ordered
          by some kind of cardinality.
